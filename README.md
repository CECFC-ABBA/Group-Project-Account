# Schedule
3/5 - Finish all classes (checking, savings, heloc), test them

3/6 - Overview of Graphics, discuss implementation < Mr. Cook wants us to have a basic GUI

        -> Graphics will be either WINAPI or the graphics headers I made < Feel free to tell me any new features you want me to add, or ask me how to use parts of it
        
3/9 - Implement graphics, write main

(3/10 - Finish everything and test it)?
