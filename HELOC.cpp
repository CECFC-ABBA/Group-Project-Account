/*HELOC.cpp
 * ABBA group memeber: Brendan McCleery.
 * 3 March 2020
 *	Purpose:
 * Everything in the HELOC class will be defined here.
 * This will keep track of home equity, the loan(and interest rate), and the fee being payed.
 * (No fee(?), Charges, Interest)
 *  The user will be enabled to see there current home equity. What kind of loan they can pull based off of that, with a random interest fee. 
 * It will display how many months is needed to pay off that loan and your current equity after pulling the loan.
